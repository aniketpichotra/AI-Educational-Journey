## Project: Practical Application in AI

### Task
- **Apply Statistical Tests** for analyzing a dataset (e.g., A/B testing).
- **Build a Regression Model** using statistical inference concepts.

### Resources
- **Tutorials**: Online tutorials on statistical analysis using Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels).
- **Guides**: Blogs or articles that walk through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing in Python.

## Continuous Learning

### Recommendations
- **Join Forums**: Participate in discussions on statistical methods and applications in AI (e.g., Cross Validated, Reddit's r/statistics).
- **Attend Workshops/Webinars**: Engage with the statistics and data science community.
- **Read Research Papers**: Stay updated with advanced statistical techniques and their applications in AI research.
